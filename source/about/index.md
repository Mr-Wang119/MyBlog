Greeting!

I'm Zhe Wang. Currently, I'm a graduate student majoring in *Electrical and Computer Engineering* at *the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign*. I first became interested in computers during middle school. I learned how to deal with them by searching the Internet, such as using FTP to access shared files. I also found ways to make tasks easier, such as running commands to shut the computer down every day after school automatically. I was attracted to computer science through this experience. I borrowed my brother’s teaching material from his university and started to learn the C Language and the basics of computer architecture. These experiences strengthened my goal to become a computer engineer in the future.

## Work Experience

I have one year of experience as a full-time software engineer in the *WeChat group* <i class="fab fa-weixin"></i> of *Tencent Technology*. In my short time there, I’ve already contributed to two main projects of the company, *WeChat for Mac* and *WeChat for Car*. These two kinds of software have nearly **5 million users**.

          Interact mainly by voice, without tapping and touching to operate the application. In the driving scenario, users can always focus on driving. By using the steering wheel buttons, drivers can quickly wake up WeChat for Car, broadcast, reply to messages, answer and hang up voice calls, and safely communicate with their friends without taking their hands off the steering wheel.

I am honored as the Good+ Contributor in *Tencent* (About 20%). I think the reason is I am open to anything new. I analyzed and optimized the full-text search code in **SQLite** to let the user search faster for history messages. By optimizing the source code, **the search speed upgraded about 20 times**. And the size of the database was reduced by about 10%. I also implemented a scalable database structure and local data service of WeChat Social Networking Services using **Swift** with **facade design pattern** and **RxSwift** to handle asynchronous requests and data flow. In addition, I optimized file download and upload logic and support for large file transfer with **Mars framework** (https://github.com/Tencent/mars), a cross-platform network library, and utilized **CGI** to interact with the backend and Protocol Buffers to serialize data.

          Distributed Deposit and Transfer System is a distributed system of multiple processes that maintain accounts and transactions. We use the ISIS algorithm to satisfy the requirement of total ordering and build a reliable multicast through implementing the reliable multicast algorithm. TCP errors are captured to detect failures.

I am also interested in distributed system areas. I have read several articles about distributed file and computing systems, such as Google File System, Big Table, Kafka, TAO, etc. The simplicity and efficacy impressed me a lot. I hope to build the same one via careful design and knowledge of related areas. I am also taking related courses and building a distributed Key-Value database system with high reliability, scalability, and consistency. Also, I am implementing a Bitcoin client using Rust with self-designed Blocks.

I am actively looking for a summer internship in the US.
