## Introduction

Hi,

My name is Zhe Wang. I am a graduate student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I have one and a half years of experience as a full-time software engineer in the WeChat group of Tencent Technology. In my short time there, I’ve already contributed to two main projects of the company, *WeChat for Mac* (https://mac.weixin.qq.com/?lang=en) and *WeChat for Car*. 



These 2 kinds of software have nearly 5 million users. I am also honored as the Good+ Contributor in Tencent. I think the reason is that I have a calm brain. And I am also open to anything new. I analyzed and optimized the full-text search code to let the user search faster for history messages. By optimizing the source code, the search speed upgraded about 20 times. And the size of the database was reduced by about 10%. I also implemented a scalable database structure and local data service of WeChat Social Networking Services using Swift with facade design pattern and RxSwift to handle asynchronous requests and data flow. In addition, I optimized file download and upload logic and support for large file transfer with Mars framework (https://github.com/Tencent/mars), a cross-platform network library, and utilized CGI to interact with the backend and Protocol Buffers to serialize data.

I am also interested in distributed system areas and would like to accumulate relevant experience. I have read several articles about distributed file and computing systems, such as Google File System, Big Table, Kafka, TAO, etc. The simplicity and efficacy impressed me a lot. Hope I could also build the same one via careful design and knowledge of related areas. I am also taking related courses and building a distributed Key-Value database system with high reliability, scalability, and consistency. Also, I am implementing a Bitcoin client using Rust with self-designed Blocks.

Actively looking for a summer internship in the US.
